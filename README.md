# telco_cust_clsfctn
This project's purpose is predicting telco company gonna churn that customer or not. For this I had telco customer dsata, first I looked into data, tried to understand relations between features and target feature. Then I looked if there is any missing values, there were so I handled them one by one. Then I checked outliers. After insights from target and others relations, I did some feature engineering. Then I applied scaling and encoding on features. I used logistic regression, k nearest neighbors, decision tree, random forest, gradient boost, xgb and lgbm models for this project. I applied cross validation to the models and picked best performers. Then I used Grid Search to hyperparameter optimization and found best parameters. Applied cross validation again and compared them respect to evaluation metrics.
